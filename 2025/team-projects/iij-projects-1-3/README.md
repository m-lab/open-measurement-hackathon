# Adding LACeS anycast geolocation dataset to Internet Yellow Pages (IYP)
Start a local IYP instance and add your favorite dataset to IYP. This would connect the imported dataset with the 60+ datasets already integrated into IYP, hence enabling new analysis. 

## Hackathon Team Presentation
The team wrote crawler scripts that adds the LACeS anycast geolocation dataset (from University of Twente) to Internet Yellow Pages (IYP). This data expands IYP by providing accurate data on which prefixes are anycasted and the geographical locations at which we find each prefix’ replicas to be announced.

This month the data should be [added to IYP](https://github.com/InternetHealthReport/internet-yellow-pages/issues/196), and the code will be available in the [IYP github repository](https://github.com/InternetHealthReport/internet-yellow-pages).
