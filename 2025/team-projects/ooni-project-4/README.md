# [OONI - Project 4] Examine TLS certificate diversity across countries/networks
This is about examining when a specific domain name presents a TLS certificate that is different or issued by a different authority depending on the vantage point that carried out the measurements.

While this can be a signal of censorship, in the event of an attempted TLS MiTM, it may also happen as a result of a different TLS certificate being used depending on the location of the server hosting the site.
