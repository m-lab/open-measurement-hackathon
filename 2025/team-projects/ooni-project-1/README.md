# [OONI - Project 1] Analyze and visualize internet censorship data
OONI created the [Measurement Aggregation Toolkit (MAT)](https://explorer.ooni.org/chart/mat) which enables you to track internet censorship around the world and create your own custom charts based on real-time OONI network measurement data. As part of this challenge, we invite you to analyze OONI data and create your own data visualization(s) based on the questions you would like to answer.

For example, this could involve exploring the following questions based on OONI data:
* Which circumvention technologies (among the [ones measured by OONI](https://ooni.org/nettest#tor)) are most effective nowadays at a given location? Is there a trend (increase or decrease) in such effectiveness?
* Where in the world are located the sites that appear blocked from a given location?
* Which censorship techniques are adopted in X country? A novel visualization could depict blocking techniques in use, sorted by degree of sophistication. Live filtering according to blocking techniques could also be useful in terms of visualization overlays.
