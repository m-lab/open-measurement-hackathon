# [M-Lab - Project 6]  “State of the Net”: Interactive Internet performance reports
Goal: Characterize the Internet performance of a region or network using open measurement datasets.

## Proposed Project:
Create a dashboard to analyze open dataset to characterize the Internet performance within a region and/or network. The visualizations can present a set of simple or composite metrics of Internet performance from several datasets, including M-Lab, Cloudflare, IODA, Internet Yellow Pagers, etc. 
[Optional] Use an AI agent (e.g., LLM-based) to explain the dashboard results and interact with the user.
