# [OONI - Project 2] Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) blocking
OONI has a test for measuring Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) called echcheck (https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/nettests/ts-039-echcheck.md). There are reports of ECH being blocked in Russia when used in conjunction with the cloudflare outer_sni cloudflare-ech.com (see: https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/417).

It would be interesting to study the evolution of this block in Russia, but also investigate if we see a signal of it getting blocked in other regions as well.
